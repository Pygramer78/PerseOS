# PerseOS: A minimalist 64-bit OS
This operating system was originally made to understand how these work.
The objective is to make it easier to use, while offering VGA libs.
You don't need to worry about graphical libraries, but you do have to worry about many other things.
For example, in **releases**, this OS has a even more minimalist version, which is actually the terminal one.
I will drop more things when i get this working
