Hi! There are some things i need to say out loud.
First of all, for all those newbies, PLEASE, compile every .c and .h file.
You can just run make to compile everything. But make sure that you erase the kernel.elf file,
that can be easily deleted with make clean.

More help will be provided.
If there's anything that isn't documented, please let me know in github's issues
